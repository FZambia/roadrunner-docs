# Health Endpoint
RoadRunner server includes a health check endpoint that returns the health of the workers.

## Enable health

To enable the health check endpoint, add a `health` section to your configuration:

```yaml
health:
  address: localhost:2114
```

Once enabled, the health check endpoint will respond with the following: 

 - `HTTP 200` if there is at least **one worker** ready to serve requests.
 - `HTTP 500` if there are **no workers** ready to service requests.
