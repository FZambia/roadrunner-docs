# Building a Server
RoadRunner use service bus model, this allows you to tweak and extend application functionality for each separate project.


#### Install Golang
To build an application server you need [Golang 1.13+](https://golang.org/dl/) to be installed.

#### Create main.go
Copy [main.go](https://github.com/spiral/framework/blob/master/main.go) file in the root of your project.

```golang
package main

import (
	rr "github.com/spiral/roadrunner/cmd/rr/cmd"
	"github.com/spiral/roadrunner/service/headers"

	// services (plugins)
	"github.com/spiral/roadrunner/service/env"
	"github.com/spiral/roadrunner/service/http"
	"github.com/spiral/roadrunner/service/limit"
	"github.com/spiral/roadrunner/service/rpc"
	"github.com/spiral/roadrunner/service/static"

	// additional commands and debug handlers
	_ "github.com/spiral/roadrunner/cmd/rr/http"
	_ "github.com/spiral/roadrunner/cmd/rr/limit"
)

func main() {
	rr.Container.Register(env.ID, &env.Service{})
	rr.Container.Register(rpc.ID, &rpc.Service{})
	rr.Container.Register(http.ID, &http.Service{})
	rr.Container.Register(headers.ID, &headers.Service{})
	rr.Container.Register(static.ID, &static.Service{})
	rr.Container.Register(limit.ID, &limit.Service{})

	// you can register additional commands using cmd.CLI
	rr.Execute()
}
```

You can now start your server without building `go run main.go serve -v -d`.

Use `rr.Container.Register` to add more services:

```golang
rr.Container.Register(custom.ID, &custom.Service{})
```
